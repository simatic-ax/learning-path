# Exercise 1: Starting tests

You will find the file "NumberIsEven.st" in the src folder. It contains a `FUNCTION` named "NumberIsEven", which will take an `INT` as input and will return `TRUE` if the number is even.

Write and execute a test for this function to check if it is working properly.

>Hint: You will have to use an `Assert` inside of a test function. The syntax for a test function looks like this:
```
{Test}
FUNCTION EvenNumber
    // Put your test code here
END_FUNCTION
```
