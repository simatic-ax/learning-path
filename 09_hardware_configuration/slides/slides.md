        In order to be able to create hardware for a plc, the first step we need to take is how the hardware configuration is described in a textual declaration for a IT like context.</p>
        <br>
            <p>The format in which the hardware configuration is created is Json. Json has the following advantages as a format:
                <ul>
                    <li>text based</li>
                    <li>readable by humans</li>
                    <li>can be easily edited with a text editor</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        <br>
        <p>The devices and dependent modules, including all properties, can be easily defined and set.</p>
