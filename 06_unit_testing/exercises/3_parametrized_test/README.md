# Exercise 3: Parametrized tests

We want to test our `SimpleCounterClass` from exercise 2 (can again be found in the src folder of this exercise) in different scenarios. Write and execute a parametrized test for this class which verifies that the counter still works correctly in different scenarios. In the solution the counter will count up 42 times from 0, 9 times from 5 and 5 times from 100.

>Hint: You will have to add input variables to your test method and call the test pragma like this: `{Test(input1 := 1, input2 := 1)}`
